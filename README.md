# Edgy Humor: Deep Learning Meme Generator

This application implements the deep learning meme generation approach described in the research paper "Edgy Humor: Image-Based Meme Generation Using Deep Learning". The system uses encoder-decoder architectures to generate humorous captions for images.

## Features

- Upload images for meme caption generation
- Select between LSTM and Transformer model architectures
- Choose between character-level and word-level tokenization
- Generate and display memes with AI-generated captions
- Download generated memes

## Model Architecture

The application implements two main model architectures:

1. **LSTM-based model**: Uses a Long Short-Term Memory network with global image embedding for caption generation.
2. **Transformer-based model**: Uses self-attention mechanisms and encoder-decoder architecture for more contextual understanding.

Both models can be used with either character-level or word-level tokenization.

## Research Background

According to the research, LSTM with character-level tokenization performed best in human evaluations:
- 44.5% of memes generated by this model were mistaken for human-made (vs. 58.8% for real memes)
- Character-level models showed less overfitting even after 40,000 training steps
- Character-level tokenization provides better generalization due to smaller vocabulary size compared to word-level models

## Usage

1. Upload an image using the file uploader
2. Select the model type (LSTM or Transformer)
3. Choose the tokenization method (Character-level or Word-level)
4. Click "Generate Meme" to create a meme with an AI-generated caption
5. Download the generated meme using the download link
